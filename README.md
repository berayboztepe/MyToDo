# MyToDo
It is a basic GUI application that provides us to track and analyse our tasks daily.


Everyone is doing some routine tasks daily. Being one of them and wanting to get experience in another programming language's GUI libraries have made me to try this project. So, I have decided to go with Python's Tkinter library. It is a very basic Python GUI application.

This application allow you to apply basic CRUD operations which means Create (Add) new tasks, Read them, Delete them and Update them.



- The application basically looks like this. In the top section, the buttons can be used to performs this CRUD operations. Also Analyse button can be used to analyse how good are you to perform these tasks.

- And checklist buttons stay as ticked in a day. When the new day begins, the data gets resetted.
